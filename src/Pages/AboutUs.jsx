    <p>
      Our world faces a huge crisis in that we're polluting our planet at a rate that will lead to temperatures rising 
      by over <b>1.5°C (2.7°F) by 2050. </b>
      The ecological damage will cause ice to melt in the arctic, oceans to acidify, temperatures to be more extreme, 
      storms to be more intense, more droughts and heat waves, and sea levels increases to displace many people.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world agreed on trying to keep temperature increase under 2.0 °C {"\n"}(3.8 °F).
      However, even if everyone abides by the Paris Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by 2100.
      If we want to reach this goal, we would need to half emissions by the end of this decade and reach net zero emissions by 2050.
    </p>
    {/* <p>
      This will massive impact on our future. If we let this problem progress, our world will heat up, causing mass extinction, 
      unbreathable air, and loss of our very important flora and fauna.
