    <p>
      Our world faces a huge crisis. We're polluting our planet at a rate that will lead to temperatures rising 
      by over <b>1.5 °C (2.7 °F) by 2050. </b>
      The ecological damage will cause ice to melt in the Arctic, oceans to acidify, temperatures to be more extreme, 
      storms to be more intense, more droughts and heat waves to occur, and sea levels to increase, displacing many people.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the 2015 Paris Agreement, the world agreed to try to keep temperature increase under 2.0 °C {"\n"}(3.8 °F).
      However, even if everyone abides by the Paris Agreement, global warming would still reach about 2.7 °C (4.9 °F) by 2100.
      If we want to reach this goal, we would need to halve emissions by the end of this decade and reach net zero emissions by 2050.
    </p>
    {/* <p>
      This will massive impact on our future. If we let this problem progress, our world will heat up, causing mass extinction, 
      unbreathable air, and loss of our very important flora and fauna.
    </p> */}

    <p>
      Our world's changing climate will affect us all. We're deeply saddened by the excinction of our flora and fauna, as well as animal species, 
      which are caused by our world's changing climate. Soon, our air will be unbreathable. But this can all stop if we start working to 
      use more clean energy practices. We can start to reverse the damage that's been done. We can start to heal the planet. But it doesn't take one person. 
      It takes all of us. And we here at Green Guardians are optimistic about our future. We're all about clean energy. It's going to be a big part of our future,
      and we're here to help you navigate.
